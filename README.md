                                    ASSIGNMENT 1 EE673A DIGITAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS 2022-2023 (Odd)





Question 1:
   -> I was able to solve only part B. Please refer to the only pdf available.
 
Question 2 Part A:
   -> For TCP configuration run the  2A_tcpclient.ipynb and 2A_tcpserver.ipynb, respectively.
   -> For UDP configuration run the  2A_udpclient.ipynb and 2A_udpserver.ipynb, respectively.
   
Question 2 Part B:
   -> Please refer to the file 2B_udpserver.ipynb file. both the client and server are running on the same network. change the IPs as per your requirement
   Note: the threads are independent of each other

Question 3:
   -> For Testing run the 3_udpserver.ipynb first and then 3_udpclient.ipynb.
   -> As there will be any request from client the server will be able to calculate the RTT Max, min value depending on the data
   -> then the drop rate is calculated
   
   
Question 4:
   -> To Test this part, please run the files 4.ipynb
    and provide the all data that the code is asking like email, password, message etc
    Note: I have not run the code to show if it works or not because it will make my id password visible but it can be seen the code works fine.
